   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anon key
3. Deploy automatically on push

**Vercel Environment Variables Setup:**
- Go to your Vercel project dashboard
- Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add both variables for Production, Preview, and Development environments

### Render
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. **IMPORTANT**: Set environment variables in Render dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anon key
3. Deploy using the included `render.yaml` configuration

### Netlify

## Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: You must set these environment variables in your hosting platform:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Where to find these values:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

**Common deployment issues:**
- White screen = Missing environment variables

- Make sure to set variables for ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development)
